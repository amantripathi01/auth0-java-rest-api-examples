================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the HelloResource class contains methods that fetch data based on user-provided input, it might be vulnerable to IDOR attacks. Attackers can manipulate references to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Always validate user input and implement access control checks. Rather than using direct references to internal implementation objects, use indirect references.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or CWE-79
Issue: If the HelloResource class is used to generate web pages and it includes user-provided data, it may be vulnerable to XSS attacks. Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the output.
Solution: Always escape user-provided data before including it in a web page. Consider using libraries that automatically escape data, like OWASP's Java Encoder for Java.

Vulnerability: XML External Entity (XXE) or CWE-611
Issue: If the application processes XML input and the XML processing is not properly configured, it could be vulnerable to XXE attacks. This could lead to disclosure of internal files, denial of service, SSRF, and even remote code execution.
Solution: Disable XML external entity processing in your XML parser configuration. Consider using simpler data formats like JSON, if possible.

"""
Scenario 1: Verify Correct Set of Classes Returned

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrectClassesReturned.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getClasses method correctly returns a set containing the HelloResource class.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange step is necessary as the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getClasses method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned set contains the HelloResource class.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns a set containing the HelloResource class. This is significant as it ensures the method is functioning as expected and returning the correct set of classes.

Scenario 2: Verify No Extra Classes Returned

Details:  
  TestName: testNoExtraClassesReturned.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getClasses method only returns the HelloResource class and no other classes.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange step is necessary as the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getClasses method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned set only contains the HelloResource class and no other classes.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method does not return any extra classes. This is significant as it ensures the method is functioning as expected and not returning any unexpected classes.

Scenario 3: Verify Set Size is Correct

Details:  
  TestName: testSetSizeIsCorrect.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getClasses method returns a set of the correct size (one, in this case).
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange step is necessary as the method doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getClasses method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned set's size is 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method returns a set of the correct size. This is significant as it ensures the method is functioning as expected and returning a set of the correct size.
