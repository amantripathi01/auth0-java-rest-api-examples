================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If a web application does not properly validate input before using it to build a URL, an attacker can manipulate the URL to redirect the user to an arbitrary, potentially malicious site.
Solution: Always validate user input and avoid including user input directly in the construction of URLs.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If user input is included directly in web pages without properly escaping special HTML characters, an attacker can inject scripts that will be executed in the user's browser.
Solution: Always escape special HTML characters in user input before including it in a web page.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If user input is included directly in SQL queries without properly escaping special SQL characters, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to perform arbitrary database operations.
Solution: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to include user input in SQL queries.

Scenario 1: Test with a valid security context

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidContext.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method returns the correct greeting message when provided with a valid security context. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid security context with a specific username.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created security context.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message against the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hello method correctly concatenates the username from the security context with the greeting message. 
  The test is significant as it confirms the method's functionality under normal conditions.


Scenario 2: Test with a null security context

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullContext.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method handles a null security context appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the security context to null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with a null security context.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null security context. 
  The test is significant as it confirms the method's error handling capability when dealing with null inputs.


Scenario 3: Test with an empty username in the security context

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyUsername.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method returns the correct greeting message when provided with a security context containing an empty username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a security context with an empty username.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created security context.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message against the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hello method correctly handles a security context with an empty username. 
  The test is significant as it checks the method's behavior with edge case inputs.
